Here is FireFlyOS


It's a operating system based on CPCDOS : https://cpcdos.net/en?_url=/en/&
You can take these files and modify them for your operating system or help me in the developpement of the project 
actually i will soon rework on FireFlyOS's User interface and Code for the OS2.2 of CPCDOS so its more useful to use the code for your own project than helping me



CPCDOS Source Code   : https://github.com/SPinti-Software/CpcdosOS2.1
(Nice project for creating your own operating system)

DOSBOX-X Source code : https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/
(Very useful for launching DOS games in FireFlyOS)
