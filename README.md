Here is FireFlyOS


It's a operating system based on CPCDOS : https://cpcdos.net/en?_url=/en/&
You can take these files and modify them for your operating system or look the code if you see something interresting


CPCDOS Source Code   : https://github.com/SPinti-Software/CpcdosOS2.1
(Nice project for creating your own operating system)

DOSBOX-X Source code : https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/
(Very useful for launching DOS games in FireFlyOS)


I have a website for my new Operating System called BlackflyOS here : http://blackflyos.rf.gd/
