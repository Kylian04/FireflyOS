BLOOD(TM) Shareware v 1.11

You carved your soul to shreds in service of a forgotten, terrible god, but 
all your loyalty bought you were false promises and betrayal. You were among 
the Chosen, Tchernobog's most esteemed generals, dark angels who were to stand
by his side and inherit the earth. But that was not to be.

Cast down and once again a prisoner of mortal flesh, you must seek out the 
rest of the Chosen-Ishmael, Gabriel, and your beloved Ophelia. Only with your 
combined strength can you find your way back to the Hall of the Epiphany and 
face Tchernobog again. Only then will you understand why he has forsaken you.

Your journey will not be an easy one, but one thing is certain. 

Blood will flow.

If you know you have a sound card and speakers but are unsure of the brand, 
select SoundBlaster for both Music and Sound Card as it is the most common.

WINDOWS95 INSTALLATION
1. Place the CD in your CD-ROM drive (typically drive D:). Unless you
   have autorun disabled, the Blood Setup will start.

   If it doesn't, or if you have an earlier version of Windows 95, 
   continue with the following steps:
2. Click on the My Computer icon on your desktop
3. Click on the icon for your CD-ROM drive
4. Double-click the INSTALL icon to start the installation program
5. Follow the on-screen prompts

Once the game is installed, double click the SETUP icon in your Blood folder 
to configure the game to your system. If you are unsure of the settings you 
should choose, either consult your computer or sound card manual or right 
click your My Computer icon and select the Device Manager tab, which should 
list the necessary information. If you know you have a sound card and speakers
but are unsure of the brand, select SoundBlaster for both Music and Sound Card
as it is the most common.

If you experience problems running Blood in Windows95, you will have to 
restart your computer in MS-DOS mode. Click on the Start button and select 
Shut Down. Select Restart the computer in MS-DOS mode? and click OK. When your
computer restarts, follow the DOS installation instructions above.

IMPORTANT!
Windows 3.1 users must exit to DOS before installing Blood. Click File in the 
top left hand corner of your Program Manager window, select Exit Windows, 
and then click OK. Note that each time you play you'll have to exit Windows 
and then switch to the Blood directory (by typing CD\BLOOD and then pressing 
[ENTER]).

STARTING A NEW GAME
When you select NEW GAME from the main menu, you will be given a choice 
between four episodes-The Way of All Flesh, Even Death May Die, Farewell 
to Arms, and Dead Reckoning. The Way of All Flesh will bring you to the 
aerie of Cheogh, the stone gargoyle, where you will seek your beloved 
Ophelia. Even Death May Die marks your quest for Gabriel, who is held in 
the lair of Shial, the Mother of Spiders. Farewell to Arms will lead you 
before Cerberus, who guards your comrade Ishmael. In Dead Reckoning, you 
will face Tchernobog himself in the Hall of the Epiphany, where perhaps 
you will learn the reason for your banishment.

Helpful Hint:	Playing the episodes in order will preserve the flow of 
the game story and ensure a more gradual increase in difficulty.

SKILL LEVEL
When beginning a new game, you must select a skill level. Blood's skill levels
affect more than the number of monsters or powerups you will find along the 
way -- the harder the level, the more damage monsters can take and dish out. 

CONFIGURING THE OPTIONS
Mouse Sensitivity
Controls the responsiveness of the game to mouse movement. The higher the 
sensitivity, the faster you'll spin.

KEY TURN SPEED
Like mouse sensitivity, key turn speed affects responsiveness to movement 
controls. This option gives keyboarders a fighting chance against mouse 
players.

GAMMA
Adjusts screen brightness. Note that higher gamma settings tend to reduce 
contrast and may also overbrighten areas that we've intentionally left dark.

DETAIL
Changes the detail level. If you are experiencing choppy image quality, try 
reducing the detail level a notch or two.

SOUND EFFECTS VOLUME
Adjusts the volume of ingame sound effects and ambient sounds.

MUSIC VOLUME
Adjusts the volume of background music.

3D AUDIO
Turns on and off the 3D audio processing in the game.  Turning this off
may result in faster frame rate.  In addition, some sound cards may have
problems with this processing.  Turning this off may allow Blood to work
on these incompatible cards.

CROSSHAIR
Toggles a crosshair for easier aiming.

SHOW WEAPONS
Enabling this option allows you to see which weapon your opponent is using in 
BloodBath. Weapons will appear above enemies' heads.

SLOPE TILTING
Controls whether or not player's view tilts in the direction of slopes. 
Disable this option to keep your view directed at the horizon.

VIEW SWAYING
Toggles horizontal "swaying" of player weapons.

VIEW BOBBING
Toggles the vertical "bobbing" of player weapons. We recommend that you 
disable view bobbing if you experience nausea while playing Blood.

CONTROLLING THE ACTION
Becoming comfortable with the movement controls is the key to success in 
Blood. These are the functions you should master if you hope to defeat 
Tchernobog. Our default controls are listed below, but you are free to 
customize your controllers to suit your playing style.

WEAPONS
Tchernobog's minions are as well armed as they are belligerent, so you will 
need to gather an arsenal of your own in order to defeat them. Each weapon 
has a primary fire and an alternate fire, and many can be powered up with the 
Guns Akimbo bonus.

NOTE: New weapon modes have been added in the Plasma Pak.

PITCHFORK
This handy tool can be very effective if you can get close enough to your foes
to use it on them. It doesn't need ammo, so you'll always have it to fall back
on if you need it.
Ammo: None

FLARE GUN
Fires burning projectiles that lodge easily in flesh and continue to burn for 
a short period of time. Unless you dive into water, you'll take damage until 
the flare burns itself out, by which time it may be too late. The alternative 
fire launches a starburst flare that douses a large area with flames. Can 
provide effective crowd control.
Ammo: Flares

SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN
A trusty companion if ever there was one. It doesn't have great range, but it 
packs a hell of a wallop up close. Can be fired either a barrel at a time or 
both at once for extra damage.
Ammo: Shotgun shells

THOMPSON'S MACHINE GUN
The Tommy Gun is a favorite of the Cabal for its rapid rate of fire and 
impressive accuracy. On the down side, it chews up ammo quickly. The 
alternative mode is a strafing attack that covers a wider area with twice as 
many bullets, which is an effective way to clear out a room.
Ammo: Bullet drums 

DYNAMITE BUNDLES
Light one up and chuck it at a group of zombies and you'll be rewarded with 
red rain and chunks of rotted flesh on the brim of your hat. The longer you 
hold down the fire button, the farther you'll throw the bundle. Watch the 
meter on the status bar to gauge the distance. The primary mode explodes on 
impact, while the alternative mode will burn all the way down before it 
explodes, making for some interesting traps.
Ammo: Dynamite bundle

REMOTE DETONATORS (COMPLETE VERSION ONLY)
Remotes work like dynamite bundles, except that you can detonate them at will.
You can bounce them off walls or ceilings if you're afraid to peek around a 
corner. The alternative fire drops a remote at your feet, and you can hit the 
alt-fire key again to place additional remotes without detonating those you've
already placed.
Ammo: Remote detonator

PROXIMITY DETONATORS (COMPLETE VERSION ONLY)
These are by far the nastiest explosives you'll come across. You can scatter 
them around and concern yourself with other matters. As soon as someone steps 
near one, you'll hear a far-off boom and accompanying shrieks of agony. Use 
the alt-fire to drop them at your feet. Also, remember where you've dropped 
proximities or you may fall prey to your own trap.
Ammo: Proximity detonator

INCINERATOR
This monstrous weapon launches a huge ball of flaming napalm at an extremely 
high velocity. If the initial explosion doesn't kill your enemy, the burning 
probably will. Best used with extreme caution, especially in tight areas. The 
alt-fire launches several napalm projectiles, covering a wider area but also 
chewing up a lot more ammo.
Ammo: Gasoline cans

VOODOO DOLL (COMPLETE VERSION ONLY)
The power of the voodoo doll is immense, but far subtler than that of a 
firearm. (The rest of this description to be determined pending finalization 
of the alt-fire attack.)
Ammo: Voodoo doll

AEROSOL CAN (COMPLETE VERSION ONLY)
Hairspray may not seem like the most daunting weapon, but apply it to a 
cigarette lighter and you've got an instant flamethrower (don't try this at 
home). While its range is rather limited, its effectiveness is quite 
impressive. You can also light one up like a Molotov cocktail and toss it into
a group of adversaries. Hit alt-fire a second time after igniting a can to 
drop it at your feet -- it will explode once it burns down.

TESLA CANNON (COMPLETE VERSION ONLY)
This powerful prototype weapon packs a mighty load of amperage. Nikola Tesla 
would be proud,

LIFE LEECH (COMPLETE VERSION ONLY)
This artifact draws its power from the life energy of your foes. Run low on 
ammo and it saps your own strength!

ITEMS

You will find various items in your journeys that will help you along your 
way. Some items will be added to your inventory -- you can use these as 
needed. Others will be activated the moment you pick them up and wear off 
after a short while, so make the best of them while you can.

HEALTH & ARMOR

ESSENCE
Boosts your health by 20 points, up to 100.

LIFE SEED
Adds 100 points to your health, up to 200 total.

BODY ARMOR
Adds 100 Body armor, which is useful against physical damage such as bullets
and explosions.

FIRE ARMOR
Adds 100 fire resistant armor, which is useful against flares, flaming 
aerosol, and the residual effects of dynamite and napalm.

SPIRIT ARMOR
Adds 100 spiritual armor, which will absorb voodoo and hellstaff damage.

BASIC ARMOR
Adds 50 of each armor type.

SUPER ARMOR
Adds 200 points of body, fire, and spirit armor.


POWERUPS & INVENTORY ITEMS

DEATH MASK
Provides temporary invulnerability to all attacks. Note that you are still 
susceptible to physics, which means a dynamite blast may hurl you off a cliff.

GUNS AKIMBO
Gives you double-fisted killing power with one-handed weapons, such as the 
shotgun, flare gun, and Tommy gun.

CRYSTAL BALL (PRESS "C" TO ACTIVATE)
In  BloodBath, this powerup enables you to see your enemies regardless of 
where they are. Cycle through your foes by repeatedly hitting the hotkey or 
Enter. To deactivate the crystal ball and save it for later, scroll through 
all opponents and it will turn off.

BEAST VISION (PRESS "B" TO ACTIVATE)
Makes your enemies stand out even in utter darkness. Very useful for spotting
concealed guards.

DR.'S BAG (PRESS "M" TO ACTIVATE)
Will restore up to 100 points of health when activated. The unused medicine 
will remain in your inventory until used up. Keep this item handy!

JUMP BOOTS (PRESS "J" TO ACTIVATE)
Enable you to jump much higher than normal. Useful for those hard to reach 
places or crossing chasms the easy way.

REFLECTIVE SHOTS
Bullets bounce back at your attackers when you are protected by this powerup.
Be careful, though, for you are still susceptible to fire and explosives.

ENEMIES
Puzzles are only part of the challenge ahead. Tchernobog's minions are 
everywhere, for they know the goal of your quest and will stop at nothing to 
stop you.

RATS
While not the deadliest of creatures, these little fiends can be quite 
hazardous if they mob you, which is their preferred mode of attack.

BATS
Bats have a nasty tendency of getting in your face when you're trying to get a
bead on deadlier creatures. Take care of them quickly if you know what's good 
for you.

SPIDERS (COMPLETE VERSION ONLY)
Don't be fooled -- spiders are dangerous enemies. The little red ones pack a 
poison that will blur your vision. The larger green ones can blind you 
completely for a short time. The poison is cumulative, so the more they bite, 
the worse the side effects.

ZOMBIES
These hardy undead menaces move more swiftly than you might expect. Take them 
out before they get close or you'll taste their rusty axe blades. Also, just 
because they're down doesn't mean they're dead -- make sure they're down for 
the count before you move on.

BLOATED BUTCHERS (COMPLETE VERSION ONLY)
Slower and more deliberate than their axe-wielding comrades, are much tougher 
to kill. You'll have to dish out a lot of abuse before they go down. Beware of
the foul goo they vomit at you, for it is both corrosive and unpleasant 
smelling.

CULTIST
Tchernobog's human soldiers are accurate and deadly. Whether they wield 
shotguns or Tommy guns, rest assured they'll give you a good fight. They may 
also lob dynamite at you from time to time, so listen for the telltale hiss 
and be ready to dive for cover.

FANATICS
These Tommy Gun packin' keepers of the dark faith want to spill your precious
life blood.  Keep your ears tuned for the deadly sounds of dynamite as they
sometimes offer explosives instead.

GARGOYLES
Your first encounter with a gargoyle will teach you to keep an eye turned 
skyward. They are as tough to kill as they are vicious. They hurl sharp bones 
at you from afar or swoop in to rake at you with their talons.

STONE GARGOYLES
Stone gargoyles are nigh invulnerable. Bullets bounce off their brittle hides 
and flames find little purchase. You'll have to be resourceful to survive an 
encounter with one of these monstrosities.

HELL HOUNDS (COMPLETE VERSION ONLY)
These fire-breathing mastiffs are swift and deadly. If they get close to you, 
their powerful jaws will make quick work of you, so keep your distance. . . 
if you can.

BONE EELS
Though somewhat timid, bone eels will dart at you the moment you turn your 
back. They make up in ferocity what they lack in fortitude.

GILL BEASTS (COMPLETE VERSION ONLY)
If you have to face a gill beast in the water, you're in big trouble. While 
slow and ponderous above water, in their element they are vicious adversaries.

CHOKING HANDS (COMPLETE VERSION ONLY)
The corpses that the minions of Tchernobog use to make zombies aren't always 
in the best of shape. Sometimes, only a limb is salvageable. Usually, the 
Cabal's surgeons can fashion various bits and pieces into a serviceable undead
soldier, but certain leftover parts can be effective all on their own. If one 
of these horrors gets hold of you, you've got to push it off before you can 
kill it.

PHANTASMS (COMPLETE VERSION ONLY)
These restless phantoms harvest the souls of their victims with vicious 
scythes. Because they exist more in the land of the dead than the world of the
living, they are only vulnerable when attacking.  Watch for them to solidify 
before striking or your ammo and effort will be wasted.

CHEOGH
Cheogh rules over all gargoyles, but he has long yearned to hold higher rank 
in Tchernobog's army. His jealousy toward the Chosen was never secret. 
Now that you have been cast from Tchernobog's graces, envy has boiled into 
sheer abiding hatred. He will be anxious to meet you again and express his 
feelings for you.

SHIAL, MOTHER OF SPIDERS (COMPLETE VERSION ONLY)
The spider demon Shial makes her lair deep within the earth in the frozen 
North. Surrounded by her arachnoid spawn, she skulks through darkness, feeding
on those who hapless souls who stumble into her cavernous labyrinth or are 
brought there by her loyal children. Those who fall victim to her learn of 
true agony as she digests them alive.

CERBERUS (COMPLETE VERSION ONLY)
Named for the mythical guardian of the gates of the underworld, this two-headed 
firebreathing demon abides in a dark, sulphurous den, hidden to the world of 
mortals. Ferocious and nigh invulnerable, Cerberus is the deadliest adversary 
you will face aside from Tchernobog himself. Remember that you must destroy 
both heads in order to defeat him.

TCHERNOBOG (COMPLETE VERSION ONLY)
His name is spoken only in whispers, for it is said that his interest is 
easily roused. Those who peer fully into his smoldering gaze are condemned to 
madness and death. You must find him before his powers become complete if you 
are to stand a chance. Even then, defeating him will require all your strength
and ingenuity. 

NEW ENEMIES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO PLASMA PAK.

Zealots (PLASMA only)
These blue-robed Tesla Cannon wielding cultists have been through special 
'training' to make them very mean.  Their armor protects them from 
electrical damage.

Ackolyte (PLASMA only)
These cultists-in-traning lob dynamite at you. Keep your ears tuned for 
the deadly hiss of an incoming bundle.

Priest (PLASMA only)
These red-robed Chosen-in-training have started their transformation into 
what you once were....  The Chosen.

Chrysalid Pods (PLASMA only)
These many-tentacled vegtable patches have trapped many an unwary advesary.
They spit a vile fluid that is sticky and very difficult to get off.

Fire Pods (PLASMA only)
These abominations have roots that go down to the bowels of the earth.
They spew lava and can do serious damage.  Be very careful not to become
fertilizer.


============================================================================
BLOODBATH

To start a multiplayer game of Blood, run SETUP and select from the following 
options:

NETWORK GAME
1.  Choose "Network Game" and press [ENTER].
2.  Select the number of players (1-8). 
3.  Leave the socket number at its default unless you experience difficulties,
    in which case you should ask your network administrator for assistance. 
4.  Enter a Player Name if you like.
5.  Select "Launch Blood" and press [ENTER]. The game will begin once the game
    has found all the players. Press escape at any time to abort before the 
    game launches.

MODEM GAME
1.  Choose "Modem Game" and press [ENTER].
2.  Select either "Wait for Call" or "Dial Your Opponent".
3.  Select "Setup COM Port" and indicate your modem COM Port. Leave the other 
    options at their defaults unless you experience difficulties.
4.  Select "Setup Modem" and find your modem on the list. If you are unsure of
    the brand, consult your computer documentation. Use the default 
    initialization, hangup, and dialout strings unless you experience
    difficulties.
5.  Enter a Player Name if you like.
6.  If you are dialing your opponent, select "Phone Number List" and enter 
    phone number.
7.  Select "Launch Blood" and press [ENTER]. The game will begin once the 
    connection has been made.

SERIAL GAME
1.  Choose "Serial Game" and press [ENTER].
2.  Select "Setup COM Port" and indicate the COM Port you are using. Leave the
    other options at their defaults unless you experience difficulties.
3.  Enter a Player Name if you like.
4.  Select "Launch Blood" and press [ENTER]. The game will begin once the 
    connection has been made.

STARTING A NEW NETWORK GAME
Game Type: Once the game has loaded, you must first select the game type from 
the Game menu. BloodBath pits players against one another. In cooperative 
play, players work together to fight monsters and progress through the game 
in a linear fashion. 

Episode and Level: Next indicate the level you wish to start with by selecting
the appropriate Episode and Level names. 

Monsters: If you want monsters in your network game, select "Bring 'Em On." 
You may also select "Respawn" for monsters that regenerate after they are 
killed.

Weapons: Permanent weapons do not disappear when picked up, so that any player
can find a weapon regardless of other players' actions within the level. Note 
that you can only pick up a weapon once -- running over it repeatedly does not
add ammunition to your inventory. Respawning weapons disappear for a brief 
time when picked up. Running over a weapon already in your arsenal will add 
ammunition to your inventory. Select "Respawn with Markers" if you would like 
a graphic to appear indicating approximately how close an item is to 
respawning (red means a long wait, yellow a medium wait, and green a short 
wait). Select "Do Not Respawn" if you want to have a pitchfork showdown.

Items: Select whether you want ammunition and powerups to reappear once picked
up. As with Weapons, you may set items to respawn with or without markers.

Respawn: (COMPLETE VERSION ONLY) This option affects where players 
respawn after dying in a BloodBath. With "Random" respawning, you will appear 
arbitrarily at any one of the respawn points. "Close to Weapons" will spawn 
you nearest to an available weapon. "Away from Players" will respawn you 
furthest from other players in the level, giving you a chance to gather some 
weapons and items before jumping back into battle.

User Map: (COMPLETE VERSION ONLY) Allows you to specify a user map to 
play.

When you are ready to play, select "Start Game" and press [ENTER].

SENDING MESSAGES
To communicate with other players during a multiplayer game, press "T" and 
type your message. Press [ENTER] to send it or [Esc] to abort.

You may send predefined macros by pressing "T" and then selecting F1--F10. 
Feel free to edit your macros from SETUP. The more creative and vindictive, 
the better.

TELEPORTERS
Some Blood levels feature teleporters that appear in BloodBath only. Learn to 
use these teleporters to get around levels quickly. Teleporter destinations 
generally appear as animated markers on the floor. Stay away from these in a 
crowded game--someone might teleport right into you.

THE BRINK OF DEATH
Sometimes you'll knock BloodBath opponents to their knees instead of killing 
them outright. The victim spends several moments swaying, poised between life 
and death. If no one reacts, the victim will slump over and die, earning you a
point. Of course, because your victim is helpless, you'll have a moment or two
to gloat. You may end the torture swiftly by blowing the victim's head off. 
You may also draw it out by tossing a lit bundle of dynamite on the ground 
nearby. Be careful, though. Victims may bring themselves back from the brink 
of death by repeatedly hitting the space bar.

You'll recognize the brink of death by the sudden drunken skewing of your 
view. When this happens, hammer on that spacebar and pray.
